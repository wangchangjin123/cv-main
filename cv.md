## Projects:
  #### Hybrid robot consisting of 18-DOF legged robot + robotic arm
   The system integrates a 12-DOF wheel-legged robot with a 6-DOF robotic arm, employing Acados's nonlinear solver and an algorithmic framework similar to ETH. Friction cone constraints in the nonlinear MPC analyze wheel-foot contact forces, ensuring kinematic feasibility. The design, resembling an Ackerman vehicle, utilizes floating-based kinematics for 18-DOF full-body Jacobian non-space control, enabling whole-body grasping and obstacle traversal with balance
  #### An unified implementation of Point-mass model for 4WIS robot
This work employs continuous optimization to unify four-wheel modes, optimizing energy consumption. Unlike traditional methods, it automatically decomposes commands into a point-mass model, enabling any-trajectory following within max velocity.
 #### A low-cost, low-inertia, low-mass compliant force-controlled robotic arm
To address challenges in mobile robotics, a lightweight, low-inertia PIEPPER-configured robotic arm is designed, featuring self-developed FOC drivers for kinematics, dynamics, and trajectory planning. The 5kg arm, discarding Moveit architecture, achieves high precision and smoothness, making it cost-effective for mobile robots.
   ####   One biomimetic eye attitude stabilization algorithm based on gravity compensation
This project focuses on biomimetic eye robots and introduces a stabilization algorithm using gravity compensation and attitude disturbance observation. Achieving disturbance rejection of 5Hz and above, it maintains end-effector stability within 0.5°.
  #### An online bionic eye external parameter calibration and computation algorithm
   For biomimetic eye robots, a method is proposed for real-time computation of binocular external parameters during motion, enhancing accuracy in locating points and recovering depth information. This approach increases the field of view for moving cameras compared to fixed ones.

 ####  A biomimetic eye active exploration algorithm based on eye-foot coordination
  Utilizing biomimetic eyes for Active SLAM, the algorithm integrates Octomap's projection maps and Gmapping's contour maps to identify visual reconstruction voids. Employing ray projection and Best View concepts, the robot achieves efficient 3D reconstruction and 2D map construction in unfamiliar environments with full autonomy
#### An adaptive dexterous hand

The dexterous hand employs a worm gear for power-off self-locking, theoretically supporting weight within structural strength limits. With a modular knuckle design and highly anthropomorphic features, it offers 20 degrees of freedom, enhancing palm grasping space by 30% through increased palm side swing freedom
